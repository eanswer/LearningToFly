* The code must run in both Python 2.6 to Python 3
* Use tabs for Python file indentation
* Use x.splitlines() instead of x.split('\n')
* Avoid "except:" and "except Exception:"
* Use Node.readf/Node.writef/Utils.readf/Utils.writef

When implementing complex features, please add examples in the showcase folder demos/
for modules under waflib/Tools, under tests/ for platform-independent unit tests,
or in playground/ for modules under waflib/extras.

The files under waflib/Tools/ are kept API-compatible for the duration
of a middle version (currently 1.9).
